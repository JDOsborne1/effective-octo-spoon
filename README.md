The goal of effective-octo-spoon is to Analyse the publicly available
data on political donations to detect pattens in polical financing.

Additionnaly it will use the drake package to generate a reproducible
workflow for the project

There were 65278 donations total in the dataset

Those donations went to a huge variety of people. (1384 in total)

For this analysis we will aggregate those unique recipients into all
those with more than 140 donations and the remainder. This leaves us
with 16 recipients, including ‘other’
